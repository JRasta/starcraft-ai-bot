#StarCraft 2 - Python AI BOT
I am currently researching PySC2 which is DeepMind's Python API of StarCraft II. This is an API which exposes Blizzard 
Entertainment's StarCraft II Machine Learning API as a Python Reinforced Learning environment. This is a joint effort among DeepMind and Blizzard to 
form StarCraft II into a rich domain for Reinforced Learning. PySC2 gives an interface to Reinforced Learning developers to associate with StarCraft II, 
allowing them to gather perceptions and send activities.

##About
I am looking to create an AI bot based upon the three races within StarCraft II: 
* Terran 
* Zerg 
* Protoss
